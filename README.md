## Objective
Aspiring Cyber Security Analyst with experience as an IT Support Technician and Network Engineer, specializing in security policy implementation and network security. Successfully improved organizational security posture by 25% through policy enhancements and implemented BitLocker encryption on 500+ devices. Holds ISC2 CC certification and a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles, eager to leverage skills to enhance security measures and protect organizational assets.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
